Tutor Wire Project
==================

Terms
-----
Frontend - the stuff you can see on the website. Built in HTML (the structure), CSS (the look), JS (adds active elements like maps), and all executed in your browser (chrome, firefox etc.)
Backend - the stuff you can't see: The business logic, templating, and database. Run on a server somewhere in a dark corner of the internet.
Stack - the technologies we are using. Visualised top to bottom starting with your web browser you get a rough idea of how info flows the system:

Stack
-----
Frontend / HTML, CSS, JS - code sent to the browser that you see.
Play! / Scala - handles requests from browers, pulls data from database, pushes data into templates, sends results back to browser
Database / PostgreSQL - stores the tutor details and any other info we want to collect

TO DO
-----
- Common page layout with site navigation.
- Home page: Introduction and search function.
- Join page: Form to register as a new tutor.
- Search results page: Uses map, geolcation, price and availability to reduce serch results.
- Tutor database.
- Hosting: Set up a free heroku instance for now as per: http://www.playframework.org/documentation/2.0.4/ProductionHeroku
- Domain: We'll point tutorwire.com to a "coming soon" page. We'll point alpha.tutorwire.com to the heroku instance.
- Code hosting: Set up github repo.

Phase 0
-------
This plan. 1hr @ £45, only chargeable if you want to proceed.

Phase 1
-------
Set up github repo and upload skeleton play project. I'll send you a url so you can see the source code, track the project and raise issues via the built in bug tracker and wiki
Deploy code to heroku. This is a 'cloud' code hosting service. It runs the code, when people access the website. We'll get a testing url where you can see the website in progress.

Optional: Configure the tutorwire domain to point to the testing site. Or we could set up a "Coming soon page". One for discussion.

Max time: 2 hours @ £45 / hour
You'll get: 
- Github url and place to manage the project
- Deployed skeleton tutorwire webstite. Not much to do but a focus for our discussions.

Phase 2
-------
- Create 'Join' form for new Tutors 
- Create database for Tutors
- Create list of all registered Tutors (first pass of search results page)
- Create Tutor profile page

Max time: 6 hours @ £45 / hour
You'll get: 
- Allow tutors to join, and show a list of all joined tutors and see a specific tutor. The frontend will be functional but won't be polished until we're happy with how it works.

Phase 3
-------
Search result filtering. We'll define this more clearly when we've got the first 2 phases in place
